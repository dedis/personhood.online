# Progress

## 14th of March

### Top-down

- Recovery of user
- wrote go-part
- testing recovery in TS
- multi trustee and recovery doesn't work because of Jasmine timeouts

- UI
- writing recover-view updateTrustees

### TODO

- Replace Darc in recovery with Credential, even if it means more lookups in the contract. But going from darc to credential is not always straightforward.
